We're so happy to have you here learning all about Gatsby, and in particular, with integrating Gatsby with Drupal as a headless CMS.

The central purpose of this first lab is to give everyone sufficient time to validate machine setup and get a local version of Gatsby and a headless Drupal instance created and running.

If you haven't already, _start_ with the [Set Up and Validation instructions here](/set-up/).

Once your environment has been validated, we can get up and running!

## Setting up Drupal

<Alert type="info">
  For this training, we will be proving a Drupal instance already pre-configured
  for each one of the attendees.
</Alert>

This Drupal instance will be running on Digital Ocean, so you do not have to worry about getting a Drupal site setup locally.

**If** you want to replicate the same Drupal installation running locally you can follow the following instructions:

<details>
  <summary>Local Drupal Set-up Instructions</summary>

## Drupal dependencies

- [git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [ahoy (ver 2)](https://github.com/ahoy-cli/ahoy)

## Drupal setup

```shell
# Clone repository
git clone git@github.com:weknowinc/drupal-boina.git

# Copy .env file
cp .env.dist .env

# Add hostname entry in your /etc/hosts file
127.0.0.1    drupal-boina.develop

# Start containers
ahoy up

# Install Composer dependencies
ahoy composer install

# Install Boina distribution
ahoy drupal boina:install
```

</details>

## Running Node.js and development server locally

Now that Drupal has been set-up _and_ our dependencies have been installed, we can get to work on Lab 1!

First, just to validate that content hasn't changed upstream (e.g. in the parent repo), we can sync with upstream.

<Alert type="info">
  If you haven't set up upstream, run:{' '}
  <code>
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/dschau/gatsby-drupal-blog
  </code>
</Alert>

```shell
git fetch upstream master
git pull origin master --rebase
```

Next, change into the lab01 directory, like so:

```shell
cd labs/01-getting-started/
```

### Setting up environment variables

We use environment variables to encapsulate _secrets_ (values that we want exposed to our build process, but that we don't want prying ðŸ‘€ to be able to access). We use a tool `dotenv` to provide these to our build process.

```shell
cat .env.sample > .env.development
```

This will take the contents of `.env.sample` and pipe them to `.env.development`. If you open up this file in your editor, you will see the hard-coded environment variables, and what needs to be changed!

Open up this file and replace the environment variables with the values you obtained when setting up the Drupal instance.

<details>
  <summary>
    Sample .env.development file
  </summary>

```shell
DRUPAL_USERNAME=your-usernmae
DRUPAL_PASSWORD=hunter2
```

</details>

<Alert type="info">
  Note: you can check out <code>gatsby-config.js</code> for further info to see
  how these environment variables are used.
</Alert>

Almost ready! Now if you run

```shell
yarn start
```

you should be greeted with the following welcome screen.

Let's just make a simple change so you can get a little more familiar with the development server, file structure, and React! We want to take the `footer` content that is currently in `src/components/layout.js` and move it to its own component at `src/components/footer.js`.

### Creating the `Footer` component

First - create the necessary component with:

```shell
touch src/components/footer.js
```

<Alert type="info">
  If on a non-Unix OS, just create the file with your IDE or Explorer!
</Alert>

Next, we want to take the `footer` structure that is in layout, and encapsulate in the `Footer` component we created. Here's an empty structure you can use:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

export default function Footer() {
  // TODO: replace with footer JSX
  return null;
}
```

Finally, import the newly created `Footer` component in `src/components/layout.js` and replace the existing `footer` content that _was_ there.

The end result should look _exactly_ as it did previously, just with a little nicer encapsulation now. You're now thinking in components ðŸŽ‰ Feel free to edit any of the code in `footer.js`, e.g. perhaps add your name!

## Wrap Up

Note that for **every** subsequent lab, the start steps will be the same. You will want to do the following for _each_ lab:

- Copy over existing `.env` files from previous lab(s)--note these will not change, so feel free to just copy them!
- `cd` to the current lab, e.g. `cd labs/01-set-up/`
- Run `yarn start` to boot-up the local development server

<Alert type="warn">
  Note: remember to exit out of the process (Ctrl + C) to close the local
  development server.
