We're so happy to have you here learning all about Gatsby, and in particular, with integrating Gatsby with Drupal as a headless CMS.

The central purpose of this first lab is to give everyone sufficient time to validate machine setup and get a local version of Gatsby and a headless Drupal instance created and running.

If you haven't already, *start* with the [Set Up and Validation instructions here](/set-up/).

Once your environment has been validated, we can get up and running!

## Setting up Drupal

<!-- TODO: Jesus -->

## Installing Dependencies

The first step when getting started with any Node.js/npm based project is to run `yarn` (or `npm install`, but we recommend `yarn` for these labs) in the root of the project. This will install any necessary dependencies and link any binaries needed for local development.

To install dependencies, run:

```shell
yarn
```

If there are any errors, inspect the console to see if they can be safely ignored. A `warning` (like peer dependencies) can be ignored, but if the install step fails please alert one of the instructors.

## Running locally

Now that Drupal has been set-up _and_ our dependencies have been installed, we can get to work on Lab 1!

First, change into the lab01 directory, like so:

```shell
cd labs/01-getting-started/
```

### Setting up environment variables

We use environment variables to encapsulate _secrets_ (values that we want exposed to our build process, but that we don't want prying ðŸ‘€ to be able to access). We use a tool `dotenv` to provide these to our build process.

```shell
cat .env.sample > .env.development
```

This will take the contents of `.env.sample` and pipe them to `.env.development`. If you open up this file in your editor, you will see the hard-coded environment variables, and what needs to be changed!

Open up this file and replace the environment variables with the values you obtained when setting up the Drupal instance.

<details>
  <summary>
    Sample .env.development file
  </summary>

  ```shell
  DRUPAL_USERNAME=your-usernmae
  DRUPAL_PASSWORD=hunter2
  ```
</details>

<Alert type="info">
  Note: you can check out `gatsby-config.js` for further info to see how these environment variables are used.
</Alert>

Almost ready! Now if you run

```shell
yarn start
```

you should be greeted with the following welcome screen. You have completed Lab One!
