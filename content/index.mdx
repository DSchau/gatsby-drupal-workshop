# Welcome to the Gatsby + Drupal Workshop

In this workshop, we'll start from the ground up to lay the foundation for how we can use the powerful combination of headless Drupal with the modern app generator [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org) to create engaging web applications. Whether you have zero React experience or tons, zero Drupal experience or tons, it is my hope that this workshop will still contain valuable information for all of these disparate camps!

In this workshop, we'll be building a blogging application powered by a number of incredible web technologies, including:

- GraphQL
- React
- Node
- Markdown
- Drupal (of course!)

Let's get started!
